# Data Communication

Data communications are the exchange of the data between two devices via some transmission medium. There are 4 fundamental characteristics for effective data communication.
- Delivery: The system must deliver the data to correct destination.
- Accuracy: While sharing the data over the network, it should not be altered.
- Timeliness: The system must deliver the data in timely manner.
- Jitter: Variation in the packet arrival time. It is the uneven delay in the delivery of audio or video packets.

## Components

Data Communication has 5 components
- Message
- Sender
- Receiver
- Transmission Medium
- Protocol

## Data Flow
Communication between the two devices can be simplex, half-duplex, or full-duplex

### Simplex
- One-way communication (unidirectional)
- Only one of the two devices can transmit the data, and the other can only receive the data
- Keyboard and traditional monitors are examples of simplex, where keyboard can only send the data (input) and monitor can only receive the data(accept output)

### Half-Duplex
- Two-way communication (bidirectional)
- Both the devices can transmit and receive the data but not at the same time.
- When one is sending, the other can only receive and vice-versa
- Walkie-talkies are half-duplex systems.

### Full-Duplex
- Two-way communication (bidirectional)
- Both the devices can transmit and receive the data simultaneously.
- Mobile phones (telephone line) is an example of full-duplex systems.

## Types of Connections

### Point-to-Point Connection
- A dedicated link between two devices.
- An example is a telephone call, in which one telephone is connected with one other, and what is said by one caller can only be heard by the other.

### Multipoint Connection (also called multidrop)
- More than two specific devices share a single link.
- A multipoint connection is a communication channel between two or more clients of the network, where all data sent by one client is received by all other clients.
